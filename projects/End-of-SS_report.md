End-of-SS report
--------------------------

Each SS ends with a report hand-in. The report must document, that the student is able to:

* Document a project or process
* Learn new skills and/or gain new knowledge
* Explain technical or other relevant material within a given context
* Present technical or other relevant material within a given context
* Do structured project management

The report will includes links and references to relevant material, either online links or appendices. The former is prefered.

Since Gitlab is used for SS, links to gitlab resources like design documents, tests and more may be relevant.
