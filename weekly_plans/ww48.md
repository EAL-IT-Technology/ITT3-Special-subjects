# Week 48 Merging to testing

## Goals of the week(s)
Pratical and learning goals for the period is as follows

### Practical goals
* We have set up a system on a test blade server.

### Learning goals
* Merging to testing
  * Level 1: Know about automated building and the steps needed
  * Level 2: Able to build a virtual machine and put it into the test environment
  * Level 3: Able to implement automated build

## Deliverable
* Weekly presentations Friday at 12:15
* Probably some personal document update
* Peergrade reviews

## Hands-on time

* Exercise 1 (LG lvl 1)

  Using the [Feynman technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkm0TNFzIeg), write 250 words about packer and how it fit with CI, using this class and project as an example. Self-evaluate afterwards by highlighting formulations and concept where you feel weak.

  You will review each other using peer grade.

* Exercise 2 (LG lvl 2)

  Use packer to build your server from the base image you defined.

* Exercise 3

  Automate building and manual deployment. This will require discussion on class on how we do the actual deployment and the actual building.


## Comments
* Read about packer here [here](https://www.packer.io/intro/), using esxi to install a VM is [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/vmware-iso.html) and using an existing image is [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/vmware-vmx.html)
* To add stuff to an ESXi it seems that we should use OVF. Pakcer supports that (see [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/virtualbox-ovf.html)) and something with ovftools (see [here](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/))
