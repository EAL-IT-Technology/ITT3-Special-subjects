# Week 47 Reproducability and testing

## Goals of the week(s)
Pratical and learning goals for the period is as follows

### Practical goals
* You have access and have tested to build procedures of others

### Learning goals
* Reproducability and testing
  * Level 1: Know what building and testing means in CI
  * Level 2: Able to implement a semi-automated workflow for virtual machines
  * Level 3: Able to implement fully automated build and test environment

## Deliverable
* Weekly presentations Friday at 12:15
* Probably some personal document update
* Peergrade reviews

## Hands-on time

* Exercise 0

  We will do a pre-mortem meeting. (3 groups)

  1. (20 min) Image that we fail in implementing the project. In the group, come up with as many reasons as possible for that to have happened.

  2. Select the top 5 most relevant.
      * `relevant` might be equivalent to `most likely` in this context
      * exclude stuff we don't have any control over, e.g. meteor showers.

  3. Write them on the whiteboard

  4. (30 min) On class, we will discuss how to prevent the problems from arizing.

      * this includes who does what.


* Exercise 1 (LG lvl 1)

  Using the [Feynman technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkm0TNFzIeg), write 250 words about how to implement the CI concepts and methodology, using this class and project as an example. Self-evaluate afterwards by highlighting formulations and concept where you feel weak.

  You will review each other using peer grade.

* Exercise 2 (LG lvl 2)

  Implement a workflow similar to the one you described in exercise 1 on your specific server.

  In this iteration, there will probably be manual steps, perhaps for building, perhaps in the test phase.  

* Exercise 3

  Automate building and testing of the server using gitlab ci pipelines.

  Start with exercise 3 from last week, if applicable.
