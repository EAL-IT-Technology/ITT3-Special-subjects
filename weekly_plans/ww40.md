## Hands-on time

* Exercise 1

  Launch a new linux instance and connect to it using SSH. Set the security groups accordingly.

In case you are using the instance launched for exercise 1, make sure you change the existing security group with one that matches your needs.

In case you are using the instance launched for exercise 3, make sure you change the existing security group with one that matches your needs.

## Comments
* Department head will probably be joining us on Thursday
* Exercises 2 and 4 are very similar, you can choose between hosting WordPress on a linux or windows instance, or you can try both.
* Check [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) before launching an instance, so you do not get billed. Always terminate your instance if you donâ€™t use it anymore. It is very important to clean after yourself while practicing on AWS.
* You may find [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hosting-wordpress.html) very useful for the exercise 2 or [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/EC2Win_CreateWordPressBlog.html) for the exercise 4.
